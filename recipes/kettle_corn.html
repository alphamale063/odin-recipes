        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 popcorn kernels</li>
            <li>2 tbsp your favorite popping oil (my go-to is Peanut)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp granulate salt (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp vanilla</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small mixing bowl, combine all dry ingredients except popcorn kernels.</li>
            <li>Heat your popcorn popper over medium heat, add oil then kernels. Ensure after this point you are constantly stirring the kernels.</li>
            <li>After about a minute, add the dry ingredient mixture. It is <em>very important</em> after this addition that <strong>constant</strong> stirring is maintained or the sugar will burn!</li>
            <li>When sugar mixture begins to melt, slowly add vanilla, attempting to not pour directly on pan surface</li>
            <li>Continue stirring until popcorn begins popping, should be about 3 minutes from addition of kernels in step 2.</li>
            <li>At this point, cover your popper while continuing to stir (if possible).</li>
            <li>When popping slows to around 1 pop every 2 seconds, quickly remove popper from heat and transfer to serving bowl.</li>
            <li>Allow to cool for minimum 1 minute, sugar will be extremely hot!</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
